MyReads Project
This is First project in one the final projects from Udacity's React Nano Degree program. I have used React to build this project.

In the MyReads project, you'll have three bookshelves that will allow you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. I will call them three type of bookshelves.

On the initial front page it will be showcasing all the books (if any) on all the three above mentioned categories of shelves. It will list the books with it's book cover, book title and author names (if available). From the drop down list icon on every book, you can shift any book from one shelf to another or even remove any book from any shelf and send it back to virtual library (i.e. backend database).

There is a add button on the bottom right which will get you to the search page and if you have cloned this app (steps given below) and running on localhost we can even reach to this seach page by typinghttp://localhost/search in browswer address bar. After reaching to the search page user will be able to search available book in the virtual liibrary by the input you type in the textbox at the top. List of available books (if any) will be displayed for you and you can move any book to any of the three above mentioned shelves type. On this search page any change in shelf assignment of any new book or any book that is already present on one of the shelf will be reflected automatically on the intial page, which you can see by going back through back button on the top left corner of search page.

To clone this project
\$ git clone https://github.com/Usama-Aslam/myRead-App-React.git

Once you have this project on your system
\$ cd myRead-App-React/

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm install OR yarn install
npm start OR yarn start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test OR yarn test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build OR yarn run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject OR yarn run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
